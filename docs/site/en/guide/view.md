# View & Interaction

## Single view vs. split view

Single view maximizes canvas space for one camera. Split view shows two views side by side
to compare orthogonal or complementary projections. It is useful for layered materials,
crystal orientations, and defect shapes.

## Split view setup

Enable two views in “Display Control” to enter split view. Choose any combination of
front, side, and top views, and adjust the ratio between the two panes.

## Linked interactions

Split view supports synchronized rotation, zoom, and selection so both views stay aligned.
Use single view when you need independent camera adjustments.

## Mouse and touch

- Scroll: zoom in/out.
- Left drag: rotate.
- Right or middle drag: pan.
- Touch: one finger rotate, two fingers zoom.

## Precise camera control

For reproducible views, enter exact XYZ rotation angles and camera distance. Use
orthographic/perspective toggle based on your visual needs. “Reset distance” brings
back the initial fit distance without changing rotation.

## Preset views and reset options

- Presets help jump to front/side/top views for consistent projections.
- “Reset distance” restores fit scale without changing rotation.
- “Reset rotation” returns to initial angles for clean comparisons.

## Reproducible export checklist

- Record XYZ angles and distance after finding the desired view.
- Unify camera across layers before comparison.
- Confirm background and projection settings before export.
