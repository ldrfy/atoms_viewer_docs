# Personalization & Settings

## Language switching

The UI supports multiple languages and can auto-switch based on system settings. You can
override it manually in the top bar (or mobile menu). Switching language does not affect
loaded data or settings.

## Themes

Dark and light themes are available. Dark is comfortable for long sessions, while light
works well for paper-ready screenshots. If background contrast is too low, the UI can
warn you (disable this in “Other Settings”).

## Other settings

General options include axis visibility, recording FPS, and optional settings for
playback or display behavior. For large models, consider lowering sphere segments and
turning off bonds in “Layer Appearance” to improve performance.

## Sync and consistency

- Use “Edit all layers” when you want the same style across layers.
- If UI contrast warnings appear, adjust background or theme settings.

## Local storage

The viewer saves preferences locally (camera, theme, and some display options). Use
“Clear local settings” to reset defaults. You can also export/import settings as JSON
when moving between machines.

## Local-first privacy

All parsing and rendering are local to your browser. For sharing, export images or
videos instead of raw data files.
