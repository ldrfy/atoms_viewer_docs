# Export & Sharing

## PNG export and background

Export PNG for papers or presentations. Choose solid color backgrounds for slides,
or transparent background for later compositing. With transparency enabled, the viewer
can auto-crop empty margins.

## Resolution and scale

Use a higher export scale for final figures, but expect more render time and memory use.
If exports fail, reduce scale or use a machine with better GPU capacity.

## Pre-export checklist

- Confirm camera angles and distance.
- Keep only necessary layers visible.
- Validate background and transparency.
- Unify style across layers for consistent figures.

## Split-view export

In split view, export outputs both panes in one image. Adjust the split ratio to match
layout needs. Switch back to single view if you only need one projection.

## Video tips

Use stable backgrounds, reasonable resolution, and limited length. Keep key frames in
focus and record only the essential segments.

## Export quality tips

- Prefer transparent background for paper composition.
- Use consistent camera angles across multiple figures.
- Keep only necessary layers visible to reduce auto-crop error.
