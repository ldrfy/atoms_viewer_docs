# Analysis & Measurement

## Atom picking

Click atoms to select them and read type/element and coordinates from the info panel.
Selection is mirrored in split view for quick cross-checking. Picking uses the active
layer, which is indicated in the UI.

## Multi-atom selection

Select multiple atoms to measure geometry:

- 2 atoms: distance (bond length or nearest-neighbor distance).
- 3 atoms: angle (bond angle or local geometry).

Clear selections after measurements to avoid confusion.

## Measurement notes

- Measurements use the active layer; switch layers when comparing structures.
- When periodic boundaries matter, verify results with dedicated simulation tools.

## Cross-layer comparison tips

- Hide non-target layers to reduce picking ambiguity.
- Align camera first, then compare layers one by one.
- For strict periodic measurements, verify with dedicated simulation tools.
